1.  Init.  Boring stuff here.
2.  Main program loop.
3.  There is no spoon.

Init:
Set up inputs and outputs.
  outputs are pixel wire,
  status lights (probably more pixels),
  fan control,
  
  inputs are big button (for running system),
  config/mode button,
  power button?  Might use long hold on config/mode for power.  Tap for mode, hold for config, hold longer for power.
  
Set up NeoPixel object.
  There's probably only one of these.  System won't use many lights, should be able to easily control all on a single bus.
  
Set up color animation palettes.
  Few defaults and a user programmable one.  That should be fun.

Set up animation objects.
  Just to have them at the ready.  Probably use the library (my modified version) defaults.

Set default palette.
  Probably rainbow spectrum becaue FABULOUS!

Set default animation.
  Probably loop fade.  Everyone loves loop fade.

Set animation starting state (none).
  Might be funny to turn it on and have disco lights but we'll be subtle.  This time.
